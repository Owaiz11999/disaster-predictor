# 🌍 AI-Powered Disaster Impact Predictor & Emergency Resource Recommender

Streamlit web app to predict disaster severity and recommend emergency resources.

## Features
- ✅ **ML-Based Severity Prediction**  
  Uses a trained Random Forest model to estimate the impact level of a disaster based on parameters like type, magnitude, and casualties.

- ✅ **Automated Emergency Resource Planning**  
  Recommends critical resources (water, food, tents, medical units, rescue teams) dynamically based on severity and population affected.

- ✅ **Interactive Geospatial Map**  
  Visualizes historical disaster data across regions using `Folium` and `GeoPandas` for deeper insights into vulnerable areas.

- ✅ **Top 10 Disaster-Prone Regions**  
  Automatically computes and displays the countries with the highest disaster frequency.
